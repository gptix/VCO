* Outline for class on using Autodesk EAGLE
** Goals
- [ ] Install software
- [ ] Review concepts
- [ ] make first project
- [ ] install and activate library
- [ ] make a project using a library
- [ ] prepare completely for ordering
** Install Software
** Concepts
- schematic
- layout
- synchronization
- libraries
- components
- nets
- rules
** Make a Project
*** Add components
*** Move and rotate compoenents
*** Connect compoents
*** Ground and Power
** Component Libraries
*** Those that come with
*** Modifying those that come with
*** Third Party
**** Adafruit
**** CEM
** Project - VCO

** Prepare for Ordering
